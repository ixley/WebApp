# We Vote Style Guide (DEMO)

** This is currently a work in progress to evaluate an approach to documenting styles and design patterns. NOT READY FOR USE **

This version of the style guide is built on [Fractal](http://github.com/frctl/fractal) and uses Node/npm.


## Getting started

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
2. Run `gulp dev` to compile and start server
3. Optionally, you can also install the Fractal CLI tool, but it's probably not necessary if you're using gulp to run commands `npm i -g @frctl/fractal`
